# Calendar Spam - what is it, and how is it different?

"Calendar spam", unsolicited calendar events and meeting invitations, is a recently exploited channel inserting unsolicited or otherwise unwanted events and invitations into calendaring & scheduling systems. It is a new form of application-specific spam which takes advantage of the application layer across multiple technologies that spans scheduling, calendaring and messaging systems.
As is the case with email spam, calendar spam is not only used to deliver unwanted information, but can also be used for malicious purposes such as phishing attempts and delivering dangerous payloads.

As calendar events and meeting invitations are often, transported and delivered via email, combatting calendar spam requires awareness, intervention, and integration with email systems and services.

Calendar spam is unique in a number of ways:

1. Calendar spam, unlike email, can be placed chronologically anywhere in calendars, in the past or the future, not just the present, making it difficult detect at the time of delivery.

2. Spam meeting invitations, may automatically see these unwanted invitations added to their calendar without their consent, with notifications sent to all their devices. These invitations are not only difficult to find, but in some cases there is no way for the user to remove these events short of deleting the entire calendar.

3. Calendar events and meeting invitations do not yet carry the rich provenance (detailed header information) which today accompanies email, making it difficult to ascertain, where and when events originated and were delivered.

4. Calendar events often contain notifications/alarms which are often propagated across a users many desktop and mobile calendaring clients.
