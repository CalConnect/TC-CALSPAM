# Calendar Spam

As this topic being one highlight session on our next conference, we want to make CalConnect working on that visible to the outside world.

This will be done publishing at least two articles on our blog with then following content:

- describing the topic from our side (What is calendar spam? Why does it more harm than email spam? ...) also trying to attract others to join us at the conference and making the connection to M3AAWG, where this topic will be discussed also

- describing mitigation strategies for service providers as well as best-practices for users (maybe even separated in two different articles)

The collection of input can be found on a dedicated GooglePad.

As the article has been published and the liaison with M3AAWG has been officially approved, the next step is to create TC CALSPAM.
